title: Key Performance Indicators
owner: <%= vars.product_name %> Metrics Platform Monitoring
---

This topic describes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that operators may want to monitor with their <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) deployment to help ensure it is in a good operational state.


## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

The KPIs in this topic are provided for operators to give general guidance on monitoring a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment using platform component and system (BOSH) metrics. Although many metrics are emitted from the platform, the KPIs are high-signal-value metrics that can indicate emerging platform issues.

This alerting and response guidance has been shown to apply to most deployments. <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that operators continue to fine-tune the alert measures to their deployment by observing historical trends. Pivotal also recommends that operators expand beyond this guidance and create new, deployment-specific monitoring metrics, thresholds, and alerts based on learning from their deployments.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Thresholds noted as "dynamic" in the tables below indicate that while a metric is highly important to watch, the relative numbers to set threshold warnings at are specific to a given <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment and its use cases. These dynamic thresholds should be occasionally revisited because the <%= vars.product_name %> foundation and its usage continue to evolve. For more information, see the <a href="metrics.html#thresholds">Warning and Critical Thresholds</a> section of the <em>Selecting and Configuring a Monitoring System</em> topic.</p>

          The number of Long Running Process (LRP) instances that the Auctioneer failed to place on Diego Cells. This metric is cumulative over the lifetime of the Auctioneer job.<br><br>
          <strong>Use:</strong> This metric can indicate that <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> is out of container space or that there is a lack of resources within your environment. This indicator also increases when the LRP is requesting an isolation segment, volume drivers, or a stack that is unavailable, either not deployed or lacking sufficient resources to accept the work.<br><br>
          This metric is emitted on event, and therefore gaps in receipt of this metric can be normal during periods of no app instances being scheduled.<br><br>
          This error is most common due to capacity issues. For example, if Diego Cells do not have enough resources, or if Diego Cells are going back and forth between a healthy and unhealthy state.<br><br>

          <strong>Use:</strong> Indicates the available Diego Cell memory. Insufficient Diego Cell memory can prevent pushing and scaling apps.<br><br>
          The strongest operational value of this metric is to understand a deployment's average app size and monitor/alert on ensuring that at least some Cells have large enough capacity to accept standard app size pushes. For example, if pushing a 4&nbsp;GB app, Diego would have trouble placing that app if there is no one Diego Cell with sufficient capacity of 4&nbsp;GB or greater.<br><br>
          As an example, Pivotal Cloud Ops uses a standard of 4&nbsp;GB, and computes and monitors for the number of Diego Cells with at least 4&nbsp;GB free. When the number of Diego Cells with at least 4&nbsp;GB falls below a defined threshold, this is a scaling indicator alert to increase  capacity. This <em>free chunk</em> count threshold should be tuned to the deployment size and the standard size of apps being pushed to the deployment.<br><br>

Dramatic decreases in this metric volume may indicate a problem with the route registration process, such as an app outage, or that something in the route register management plane has failed.<br><br>
          If visualizing these metrics on a dashboard, <code>gorouter.total_routes</code> can be helpful for visualizing dramatic drops. However, for alerting purposes, the <code>gorouter.ms_since_last_registry_update</code> metric is more valuable for quicker identification of Gorouter issues. Alerting thresholds for <code>gorouter.total_routes</code> should focus on dramatic increases or decreases out of expected range.<br><br>

          The lifetime number of requests completed by the UAA VM, emitted per UAA instance. This number includes health checks.<br><br>
          <strong>Use:</strong> For capacity planning purposes, the aggregation of these values across all UAA instances can provide insight into the overall load that UAA is processing. <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends alerting on unexpected spikes per UAA instance. Unusually high spikes, if they are not associated with an expected increase in demand, could indicate a DDoS risk and should be investigated.<br><br>
          For performance and capacity management, look at the UAA Throughput metric as either a requests-completed-per-second or requests-completed-per-minute rate to determine the throughput per UAA instance. This helps you see trends in the throughput rate that may indicate a need to scale UAA instances. Use the trends you observe to tune the threshold alerts for this metric.<br><br>
          From performance and load testing of UAA, Pivotal has observed that while UAA endpoints can have different throughput behavior, once throughput reaches its peak value per VM, it stays constant and latency increases.<br><br>

          For optimizing UAA, consider this metric in the context of UAA request latency and UAA VM CPU utilization. To increase throughput and maintain low latency, scale the UAA VMs horizontally by editing the number of your <strong>UAA</strong> VM instances in the <strong>Resource Config</strong> pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile and ensure that the <code>system.cpu.user</code> metric for UAA is not sustained in the suggested range of 80-90% maximum CPU utilization.
