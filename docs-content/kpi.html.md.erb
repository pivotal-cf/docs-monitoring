title: Key Performance Indicators 
owner: PCF Metrics Platform Monitoring
---

This topic describes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that operators may want to monitor with their Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment to help ensure it is in a good operational state.

The following PCF v1.12 KPIs are provided for operators to give general guidance on monitoring a PCF deployment using platform component and system (BOSH) metrics. 
Although many metrics are emitted from the platform, the following PCF v1.12 KPIs are 
high-signal-value metrics that can indicate emerging platform issues. 

This alerting and response guidance has been shown to apply to most deployments. 
Pivotal recommends that operators continue to fine-tune the alert measures to their deployment 
by observing historical trends. 
Pivotal also recommends that operators expand beyond this guidance and create new, deployment-specific monitoring
metrics, thresholds, and alerts based on learning from their deployments.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Thresholds noted as "dynamic" in the tables below indicate that while a metric is highly important to watch, the relative numbers to set threshold warnings at are specific to a given PCF environment and its use cases. These dynamic thresholds should be occasionally revisited because the PCF foundation and its usage continue to evolve. See <a href="metrics.html#thresholds">Determine Warning and Critical Thresholds</a> for more information.</p>

          <br><br>
          <strong>Use</strong>: Indicates the available cell memory. Insufficient cell memory can prevent pushing and scaling apps.
          <br><br>
          The strongest operational value of this metric is to understand a deployment's average app size and monitor/alert on ensuring that at least some cells have large enough capacity to accept standard app size pushes. For example, if pushing a 4GB app, Diego would have trouble placing that app if there is no one cell with sufficient capacity of 4GB or greater.
	  <br><br>
	      As an example, Pivotal Cloud Ops uses a standard of 4GB, and computes and monitors for the number of cells with at least 4GB free. When the number of cells with at least 4GB falls below a defined threshold, this is a scaling indicator alert to increase  capacity. This <em>free chunk</em> count threshold should be tuned to the deployment size and the standard size of apps being pushed to the deployment.<br><br>

	      <li>Create a script/tool that can iterate through each Diego Cell and do the following: 
          <ol>
          <li>Pull the <code>rep.CapacityRemainingMemory</code> metric for each cell.</li>
          <li>Divide the values received by 1000 to get the value in Gigabytes (if desired threshold is GB-based).</li>
          <li>Compare recorded values to your minimum capacity threshold, and count the number of cells that have equal or greater than the desired amount of <em>free chunk</em> space.</li>    
	       </ol>
	 <li> Determine a desired scaling threshold based on the minimum amount of <em>free chunks</em> that are acceptable in this deployment given historical trends.</li>
	 <li> Set an alert to indicate the need to scale cell memory capacity when the value falls below the desired threshold number.</li>
	      </ol> 
	<b>For visualization purposes</b>:<br>
	      Looking at this metric (<code>rep.CapacityRemainingMemory</code>) as a minimum value per cell has more informational value than alerting value. It can be an interesting heatmap visualization, showing average variance and/or density over time.

        <br><br>
        <strong>Use</strong>: Indicates an impending issue with the Gorouter.
        Without proper mitigation, it is possible for an unresponsive app to eventually exhaust available Gorouter file descriptors and cause route starvation for other apps running on PCF. Under heavy load, this unmitigated situation can also result in the Gorouter losing its connection to NATS and all routes being pruned.
        <br><br>
        While a drop in <code>gorouter.total_routes</code> or an increase in <code>gorouter.ms_since_last_registry_update</code> helps to surface that the issue may already be occurring, alerting on <code>gorouter.file_descriptors</code> indicates that such an issue is impending.
        <br><br>
	      The Gorouter limits the number of file descriptors to 100,000 per job. Once the limit is met, the Gorouter is unable to establish any new connections.
	      <br><br>
	      To reduce the risk of DDoS attacks, Pivotal recommends doing one or both of the following:
        <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Within Elastic Runtime, set <strong>Max Connections Per Backend</strong> to define how many requests can be routed to any particular app instance. This prevents a single app from using all Gorouter connections. The value specified should be determined by the operator based on the use cases for that foundation. For example, Pivotal sets the number of connections to 500 for Pivotal Web Services.</li>
	          <li>Add rate limiting at the load balancer level.</li>

          To increase throughput and maintain low latency, 
          scale the Gorouters either horizontally or vertically

		Pivotal also recommends alerting on this metric if the number of routes falls outside of the normal
                    range for your deployment. For example, dramatic increases in the total routes outside of expected business 
                    events might point to a denial-of-service attack. 
                    Or, dramatic decreases in this metric volume might indicate a problem with 
                    the route registration process, such as an
                    app outage or that something in the route register management plane has failed.
			<br><br>
			If visualizing these metrics on a dashboard, <code>gorouter.total_routes</code> can be helpful by visualizing dramatic drops. However, for alerting purposes, the metric <code>gorouter.ms_since_last_registry_update</code> is more valuable for quicker identification of Gorouter issues. Alerting thresholds for <code>gorouter.total_routes</code> should focus on dramatic increases/decreases out of expected range.
