This guide describes how Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) operators can monitor their Pivotal Application Service (PAS) deployments. For information about monitoring Pivotal Container Service (PKS) deployments, see [Logging and Monitoring PKS](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/monitor.html).

For more information about logging and metrics in PCF, see [Overview of Logging and Metrics](../loggregator/data-sources.html).

##<a id="guide"></a> Overview

This guide includes the following topics: 

* <a class="subnav" href="./kpi.html">Key Performance Indicators</a>: A list of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that operators may want to monitor with their PAS deployment to help ensure it is in a good operational state.
* <a class="subnav" href="./key-cap-scaling.html">Key Capacity Scaling Indicators</a>: A list of capacity scaling indicators that operators may want to  monitor to determine when they need to scale their PAS deployments.
* <a class="subnav" href="./metrics.html">Selecting and Configuring a Monitoring System</a>: Guidance for setting up PAS with monitoring platforms to continuously monitor component metrics and trigger health alerts.

##<a id="new"></a> KPI Changes from PAS v2.3 to v2.4

This table highlights new and changed KPIs in PAS v2.4.

<table> 
  <tr>
    <td><em>Removed</em></td>
    <td>KPI: <strong><code>gorouter.registry_message.route-emitter<br>route_emitter.HTTPRouteNATSMessagesEmitted</code></strong><br><br>
          In PAS 2.4 and above, GoRouter will skip the TTL for routes that are registered with TLS. So the routes will never expire or be pruned (other than in an attempt to connect to an invalid backend), which means these metrics are no longer an accurate representation of routing health.
    </td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Modified</em></td>
    <td>KPI: <strong><code>locket.ActiveLocks</code></strong><br><br>
      The Clock Global (Cloud Controller clock) job now also holds a component lock. Therefore the expected number of Active Locks increased to 5. If the Operator disables Zero Downtime App Deployments when configuring PAS, then the expected value will remain 4 for PAS v2.4.

  </tr> 
    <tr>
    <td><em>New</em></td>
    <td>KPI: <strong><code>doppler_proxy.slow_consumer</code></strong><br><br>
     This metric indicates that a Firehose consumer, such as a monitoring tool nozzle, is ingesting messages from the Firehose too slowly. 
    </td>
    <td><a href="./key-cap-scaling.html#slow-consumer">Link</a></td>
  </tr> 
    <tr>
    <td><em>New</em></td>
    <td>KPI: <strong><code>rlp.dropped, direction: egress</code></strong><br><br>
     This metric indicates that a Reverse Log Proxy (RLP) consumer, such as a monitoring tool nozzle, is ingesting RLP messages too slowly.
